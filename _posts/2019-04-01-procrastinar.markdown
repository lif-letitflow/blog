I've been thinking recently about procrastination. But what is exactly procrastination? I read somewhere that it was a way to escape the things that we don't like, and while doing so we might do something that we had to do.

But what if is it not the right time to do the task I've been procrastinating on?

Why do I have to do something I don't like?

Which task is so important that I am unable to do, but I can't keep going without doing it?

I don't know if what I am going to say is correct, but for me right now that task is studying. I don't want to do it, I don't want to learn what someone else says I should learn, I want to learn whatever I want. I love learning, but not like this. Some people will say that it is necessary if you want a good job later in life, so you earn what you consider a good amount of money. But I don't want money, I just want to learn and live at its fullest without thinking about money.

A few months ago, I was talking to a friend, asking him what would he do if he didn't have to think about money. The question I made him was something like this: if I was able to sustain you money wise, without asking you where the money was going to be spent, and you could do anything in your life, what would you do? His answer: travel, writing my own stories and the stories of the people I meet, but also, it would be weird because he might end up spending the money in something else, alcohol, drugs, staying in one place... Can we choose what we want in our own lives? Are we really able? Or do we only choose based on the circumstances and the things we see most at hand?

If the above paragraph doesn't make sense in this context, maybe the next question will relate both concepts talked in this page.

Would we procrastinate the same if we didn't have to worry about money? Or is procrastination a consequence of our own creations?
