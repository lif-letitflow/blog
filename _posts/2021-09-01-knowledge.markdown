Do we really gather knowledge faster than wisdom?

What is knowledge and what is wisdom. Knowledge is the information, and wisdom is being able to relate the knowledge to further Â¿better? society.

From my point of view, wisdom is learned from experience, based on the knowledge one has. Something will be tried, and after having the results of that action, wisdom is created.

But, what happens in a society? In a society it is much more complex. Philosophers from the past have tried to teach about wisdom, as this knowledge and wisdom being distributed throughout the world, by territories, countries, towns and __languages__.

It is true that one can have knowledge about what is happening in other places, or the last research that was published for some area in any language, but not the wisdom. The wisdom that a town acquires through their experiences and difficulties, through the natural disasters they live; and the same applies to the rest of social organizations, adding up the culture that is being transmitted from generation to generation.

Wisdom is much, much harder to transmit than knowledge, but this knowledge will be one day used to create wisdom.

I don't think this is happening now, I think this has happened from the beginning, and the solution is to unify cultures, languages and territories as much as we can, because wisdom comes from this unification, while knowledge could come without it.
