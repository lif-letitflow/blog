Today I had to say goodbye to a person I spent a lot of time with. She was good with me and I think I was good with her, but was I? Only she can answer that.

Procrastination, as a dear friend told me, is what I was doing not answering her.

Why don't I say her name? Because it's too painful, as was reading what she wrote to me and answering her.

Be well, my friend, I'll always miss you.
